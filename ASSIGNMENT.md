# DSCI 554 Group Project

## Description

In your final project, your team will produce a **demo paper** as if submitted to a data visualization conference. For this, you will write a **research paper**, build and deploy a **demo**, create a **video**, and deliver a presentation to the class. The goal of the project is to design an interactive visualization system or tool that addresses a unique data-driven problem and that addresses visualization challenges. As such, this project shows how you can apply class concepts to solve visualization challenges and communicate your contributions professionally.

### Requirements

- Paper: A research paper about their project as if they were submitting it to a conference for publication. The paper should follow the [LNCS format](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0), be **at most 5 pages long**, and include sections on the **introduction, data, approach** (including design, technical considerations, development, and evaluation), **system, related work, conclusions,** and **references**. Each paper should be clearly written, concise, and organized professionally. **Overleaf** is required to write the paper. 
- Demonstration. This includes the code base of the demonstration and the deployed demonstration. The deployed demonstration should be publicly accessible. You must use React or Vue.js with Bootstrap, or Streamlit with Bootstrap. Examples with instructions on how to deploy:
    - [React App GitHub](https://github.com/dsci-554/react-example) and [React App GitHub.io deployed link](https://dsci-554.github.io/react-example)
    - [Vue App GitHub](https://github.com/dsci-554/vue-example) and [Vue App GitHub.io deployed link](https://dsci-554.github.io/vue-example)
    - [Streamlit App GitHub](https://github.com/dsci-554/streamlit-example) and [Streamlit App GitHub.io deployed link](https://dsci-554.streamlit.app/)
- Presentation of 5 minutes using Google Slides. The presentation can show parts of the video without audio, and interaction with the demonstration.
- Video. The video should be less than 2 minutes, be posted on YouTube and be publicly accessible. The video should be understandable by non-experts and clearly communicate your contributions.

### Submission

Students are expected to:

- Update PROJECT.md
- Commit the code base of the demonstration in this repository
- Present to the class as if it were at a conference session.

## Rubric

| **Category** | **Excellent (4–5 pts)** | **Satisfactory (2–3 pts)** | **Needs Improvement (0–1 pts)** |
|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Paper: Organization & Presentation** | Paper is well-organized, clearly written, and professionally presented. Figures, tables, and captions enhance understanding and follow formatting standards. | Paper is readable and mostly organized, with minor language or formatting issues. Visual elements are present but could be better integrated. | Paper lacks organization or clarity. Language and visuals significantly detract from comprehension. |
| **Paper: Purpose & Contribution** | Purpose, contributions, and visualization challenges are clearly articulated. References are relevant and correctly cited in LNCS format. Limitations and future work are thoughtfully discussed. | Purpose and contributions are somewhat clear. References are adequate but may be limited or partially misformatted. Some discussion of limitations or future work is present. | Purpose and contributions are vague. Few or no relevant references. Missing or incorrect citations. No discussion of limitations or future directions. |
| **Paper: Methodology & Implementation** | Design and implementation process is well-explained and justified. Gen AI, if used, is effectively integrated. Visual display demonstrates sound technical and design decisions. | Methodology is present but lacks clarity or completeness. Gen AI usage is mentioned but not well-integrated. Design decisions are partially justified. | Methodology is unclear or missing. Gen AI usage is absent or unproductive. Implementation lacks coherence or depth. |
| **Project Repository** | Uses Bootstrap and one of React, Vue.js, or Streamlit effectively. Codebase is well-structured. `README.md` clearly documents setup, usage, and system description. Project is deployed and publicly accessible. | Framework and Bootstrap are used but not consistently or effectively. `README.md` is present but may be missing key information. Deployment may be incomplete or buggy. | Framework use is minimal or absent. `README.md` lacks critical details. Project is not deployed or cannot be accessed. |
| **Presentation** | Presentation is polished and engaging. Purpose, contributions, and challenges are clearly conveyed. Effectively incorporates video clips and explains visual design choices. Discusses limitations and future work. | Presentation communicates the project but may lack clarity or engagement. Some use of video or examples. Limited discussion of challenges or future work. | Presentation is confusing or unengaging. Video or project overview is missing. Lacks reflection on challenges or next steps. |
| **Video Demo** | Video is less than 2 minutes concise, well-narrated, and clearly showcases system functionality and design. Visuals are clear and informative. | Video communicates main ideas but may be too long, lack clarity, or miss key components. Visuals or voice-over could be improved. | Video is missing, unclear, lacks narration, or fails to convey key elements of the project. |
| **Attendance** | Full attendance and participation in project labs. | Few unexcused absences and or lack of participation in project labs. | Unexcused absences and insufficient participation in project labs. This may result in up to a 5% deduction of the final individual project grade. |
